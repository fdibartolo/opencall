However, remember that the last day of the conference will be on an Open Space format, so bring your idea and present it to the audience during the marketplace, as you might have a chance to gather people interested in your topic.\n\nShould you have any queries, requests or comments, do not hesitate to contact the Program Committee at %{email}.\n\nThank you very much for your proposal, and we hope to see you at the conference and Open Space.\n\nSincerely,\nProgram Committee of Agiles 2015 Conference\n\n[Please do not reply to this e-mail.
